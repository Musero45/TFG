The most direct way to do this is to define a cell of helicopters by transforming a reference helicopter by changing the desired parameter. For instance, let us consider we want to analyse how the variation of the induced power correction factor changes the required power for hovering. Then, we build up a cell of SuperPuma energy helicopters by varying the main rotor induced power correction factor kappa between 1.0 and 1.2 using the function getParametricCellHe. The function getParametricCellHe creates a cell of helicopters given a reference helicopter, a vector of parameter to be assigned to a valid field name of the reference helicopter. In this example a parametric variation of the reference helicopter is created by varying the induced power correction factor between 1.0 and 1.2 while keeping constant the rest of the helicopter parameters. First we define the induced power correction factor vector, then we define the parameter string which should be a valid  fieldname, including dots in case of a substructure field and then we use getParametricCellHe. The variable hei stores a cell of 11 helicopters.</p><pre class="codeinput">kappai     = linspace(1.0,1.2,11);

</pre><p>If we try to plot directly such a power state using plotPowerState we can find that the relevant variable which is the induced power correction factor it does not belong to the power state so there is no information of the helicopter at the power state level. However, we can push plotPowerState to try to plot the power state ps by representing power as a function of the, let us say, forward velocity which is for every power state obviously zero. As it can be expected a vertical line of points is plot because forward velocity is constant and equal to zero and power is varying because of the induced power correction factor variation.

%%
% We would like to represent the required power for hovering as a function
% of the induced power correction factor but the power state structure does
% not know anything about the parameter variation undergo by the

pps        = coswmf_cos2swmf(ps,hei,parstr);

%% Helicopter parameter variation for a vector of flight conditions
% A vector of flight conditions is just a flight condition structure
% in which each field of the structure is a vector of real values. In this
% section we are going to compute the required power for hovering 
% as a function of the altitude and induced power correction factor
%
% The first step is to define a vector of hovering flight conditions at

% by varying the altitudes between sea level and 1000 meters.
H          = linspace(0,1000,31);
fci        = getFlightCondition(he,'H',H);


%%
% Now using the previously defined cell of helicopters in which a
% parametric variation of induced power correction factor has been carried
% out we can compute the corresponding power state, ppsi, which represents
% a power state function of the two variables, that is, function of
% altitude and induced power correction factor. As before, getPowerState
% returns a cell of power state structures of size the same size then 
% the helicopter input argument, that is a cell row vector of size 1x11.
% However, each slot of the output cell contains a power state structure 
% with fields containing a row vector of size 1x31 which represents the
% variation of the power state with respect to the flight altitude
%
ppsi       = getEpowerState(hei,fci,atm);

%%
% Once again, the ppsi power state does not have any information about the 
% induced power correction factor variation. Therefore we should add it
% using the function coswmf_cos2swmf as before. Now, the resulting power
% state structure ppsij is a structure with fieldnames containing matrices
% of size 
ppsij      = coswmf_cos2swmf(ppsi,hei,parstr);

%%
% Then, using the previously defined x and z axis we should add a new y
% axis by defining the y variable as the altitude
ayds       = getaxds('H','$H$ [-]',1);

%%
% Once the cell of structures with matrix fields, ppsi, has been 
% transformed to the structure with matrix fields, ppsij, plotPowerState 
% can be used to plot in a meaningful way, the helicopter parameter 
% variation. Now and because the power state depends on two variables we can

% Before plotting the bidimensional cell array we are asked for adding to
% the cell array of scalar power states the bi-parameter variation
% information. Once again function coswmf_cos2swmf adds such information by
% especifying both parameter strings, i.e. 'mainRotor.kappa' and 
% 'mainRotor.cd0'. Therefore we transform the cell array of scalar power
% states, psij, into a structure with 2d-matrices fields, pcsij. As it is
% expected each field of the structure pcsij contains a matrix of size 11x5
% elements.
pcsij      = coswmf_cos2swmf(psij,heij,parstr,heij,parstr2);


ayds        = getaxds('cd0','$c_{d0}$ [-]',1);
plotPowerState(pcsij,axds,ayds,...
               'plot3dMethod',@surfc,...
               'defaultVars',azds ...
              );

plotPowerState(pcsij,ayds,axds,...
               'defaultVars',azds,...
               'plot3dMode','parametric' ...
              );

% DEVELOPMENT NOTES
%
% The following part of code is an attempt to show a trick to easily plot. 
% This should be reworked and if we come up with a solution put 
% after line 68.
%
% In order to overcome this difficulty we can use the following quick hack. 
% We can overload the power state structure by adding a new field 
% with the induced power correction factor information and using 
% plotPowerState.
% psk        = ps;
% psk.kappa  = kappai;
% axds       = getaxds('kappa','$\kappa$ [-]',1);
% axpsk      = plotPowerState(psk,axds,[],'defaultVars',azds);
